This is a list of awesome compute grants that academics + researchers can use for machine learning research.

A few notes:
- Grants often require a quick application (larger awards may require a research proposal)
- Grants may have eligibility requirements (enrolled student, faculty member) or research requirements (specific topic, publicly release results)
- Grant awards are often in the form of either compute credits or cluster access
- This list focuses on grants that are a minimum of $1,000 worth of resources
- Most grant awards are technically advertised as "up to $x,xxx", but I write "$x,xxx$" instead since that is typically the amount given
